Do candy crush problem.

REVIEW FIND PEAK ELEMENT 2DD VERSION!



FOR integerbreak -> look at math soln

Completed convertTernaryToBinaryTree. Finish up the  iterative stack soln for it, as well as
    add notes on it in Algo README, on the wierd shit you had to do.
    The iterative soln would be very helpful to know!!!!

    -> Also do its friend problem -> Construct Binary Tree from String
    -> Also do basic calculaor, 1,2,3,4


For generate parenthesis can you do DP? GET NOTES FOR THIS. 


REVIEW BIDIRECTIONAL BFS PYTHON SOLUTION FOR Open the Lock in important questions.

RESAARCH RESULTS FOR 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array 
        
        -> write notes on how you got the solution!
        Wrote down the rules.
        Write down the big rules that satisfy the world constraints
        then write down the local constraints for that world
        the way you write the if statements matters!
        An if statement should seperate worlds aka 
        the sorted world vs unsorted pivot world

        -> Also try DOING a circular array using mod! and finding the pivot!
        -> getting key things like the pivot make the problem easier!
        soemtimes easier to break the problem up and do it that way. 


COMPLETED 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
    REVIEW IT, -> IMPROVE IT  -> MAKE FASTER -> LOOK AT DISCUSSION 
    -> MAKE SOME BETTER SOLUTIONS LIKE ITERATIVE ETC,

Write notes on 911. Maximum size subarray sum equals K in most important problems

Write notes about 3D surface area? 


Fix all topolical sort -> the error is you are assuming that you can fill 
the visited set with the nodes of the first 
path in all paths but actually each path in all paths can be different, 
so you have to deal with at the individual level.

Write notes on below questions:

Cap1 OA, first 2 questions were easy and tbh cannot remember them
3rd one was basically: you're given a var schedules, a list of lists; each schedule[i] is the schedule of a person that contains
intervals in the form of [start, end] of the  meetings they have in a  24 hour period. You are also given length, the length of a
meeting you want to schedule. You need to find the earliest time for the meeting to start s.t. all the people can join. If there
is no such time, find a time s.t. the greatest number of people can join

Find the intervals they dont have meetings (do the inverse of the intervals they have in the 24 hour day).
Order those intervals by start time.

process starts, increment counter, process ends decrement counter.
    If counter == # of people check if interval > lengthOfmeeting and return.

To deal with: If there is no such time, find a time s.t. the greatest number of people can join

When you process start and end intervals:
    -> keep track of the max ppl available (which is max(maxcounter, counter)) + start interval for that end interval, and check if the interval you are checking is > lengthofmeeting,
    to answer the question (and then you can start time for the meeting with the greatest # of ppl)

(does this logic look correct?)



4th one was: you're given a list operations, where each elem of operations is the form [0,a,b] or [1,a,b], where 0 or 1 is an operation,
a,b are the length/width of a rectangle (a x b). If op == 0, you create and save the rectangle. If op == 1, then you take your current
rectangle and check to see if it can fit in all previously saved rectangles. You can rotate your current rectangle (s.t. the dimensions
are now b x a instead of a x b). If it can fit in all previous rectangles, append True to a res array. If it does not, append False to
a res array. Then return your res array.
