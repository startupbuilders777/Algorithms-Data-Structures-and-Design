The function random returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0).
Each time you call random, you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run
this loop:

import random
for i in range(10):
x = random.random()
print x

The function randint takes parameters low and high and returns an integer between low
and high (including both).

>>> random.randint(5, 10)
5

>>> random.randint(5, 10)
9

To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use choice:
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]

>>> random.choice(t)
2

>>> random.choice(t)
3

The random module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous
distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more
