        transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 

        Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  

        Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing amount for at least three consecutive days. Include the customer_id, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

        Return the result table ordered by customer_id in ascending order.

        The query result format is in the following example.

        | 5  | Jeames  |
        +----+---------+
        Explanation: 
        Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

        Approach I: Using flow control statement CASE [Accepted]
        Algorithm

        For students with odd id, the new id is (id+1) after switch unless it is the last seat. 
        And for students with even id, the new id is (id-1). In order to know how many seats in total, we can use a subquery:

        SELECT
            (CASE
                WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts != id THEN id + 1
                WHEN MOD(id, 2) != 0 AND counts = id THEN id
                ELSE id - 1
            END) AS id,
            student
        FROM
            seat,
            (SELECT
                COUNT(*) AS counts
            FROM
                seat) AS seat_counts
        ORDER BY id ASC;



178 DISTINCT RANKS:
        Table: Scores

        +-------------+---------+
        | Column Name | Type    |
        +-------------+---------+
        | id          | int     |
        | score       | decimal |
        +-------------+---------+
        id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
        Each row of this table contains the score of a game. Score is a floating point value with two decimal places.
        

        Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:

        The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
        If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
        After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
        Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.

        The result format is in the following example.

        

        Example 1:

        Input: 
        Scores table:

        +----------------+----------+
        (user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
        user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
        action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
        Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
        

        The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

        Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

        Return the result table in any order.

        The result format is in the following example.

        | Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
        +------------+----------+--------+
        Explanation: 
        In the IT department:
        - Max earns the highest unique salary
        - Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
        - Will earns the third-highest unique salary

        In the Sales department:
        - Henry earns the highest salary
        - Sam earns the second-highest salary
        - There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees



        SELECT d.name AS 'Department', 
            e1.name AS 'Employee', 
            e1.salary AS 'Salary' 
        FROM Employee e1
        JOIN Department d
        ON e1.departmentId = d.id 
        WHERE
            3 > (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
                FROM Employee e2
                WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary AND e1.departmentId = e2.departmentId);

    In the correlated subquery, we select the number of salaries from the same table Employee. 
    To compare the salaries between the main query and the subquery, we make sure the department 
    is the same from both queries, but the salary from the subquery is always bigger than the salary from the main query.

    (
        SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
        FROM Employee e2
        WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary AND e1.departmentId = e2.departmentId
    )
    Since we need to identify the top three high earners in the main query, and 
    the subquery always has larger salaries than the salaries from the main query, 
    the maximum count of the larger salaries in the subquery is two. We add this criteria as a filter to the main query.

        Explanation: 
        User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
        User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
        

        Follow up: Could you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for n or more consecutive days?

        +-------------+---------+
        (followee, follower) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
        Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.
        There will not be a user following themself.
        

        A second-degree follower is a user who:

        follows at least one user, and
        is followed by at least one user.
        Write a solution to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers.

        Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order.

        The result format is in the following example.

        Explanation: 
        User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table.
        User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.
        User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.

        Good question ! The short answer to your questions is "order of execution". In this solution, the 
        "GROUP BY" executes before the window function. Window functions execute in the SELECT clause (last if
         you don't have an ORDER BY or LIMIT clause). In my opinion, this solution is very efficient cause it 
         solves the problem with 2 table scans, only.( 1 table scan call to Matches and 1 table scan call to Player)
